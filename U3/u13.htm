    <textarea class="text-area text-color" readonly placeholder="To kick off the process of planning and creating the 'Mobile World Station' website for my assignment, I started by outlining the key objectives and requirements. I began made sure to understand the target audience's preferences and needs when it comes to mobile phones, accessories, and services. With this information in mind, I brainstormed ideas for the website's layout, structure, and content.

Once I had a clear plan, I began creating structure charts and mockups using Google Drawings. I focused on creating a clean and user-friendly design that would effectively showcase the products and services offered by Mobile World Station. Throughout the design process, I prioritized simplicity and ease of navigation to ensure a positive user experience.

After creating the initial design, I carefully considered alternative options and evaluated their suitability based on factors such as aesthetics, usability, and alignment with the intended purpose of the website. I ultimately rejected designs that were overly complex, cluttered, or did not effectively highlight the products and services.

With the design finalized, I proceeded to develop the website, utilizing HTML to code the layout and incorporate various elements such as images, text, and navigation menus. I prepared assets including product images, logos, and promotional banners to enhance the visual appeal of the website.

Once the development phase was complete, I thoroughly tested the website to ensure functionality across different devices and browsers. I conducted usability testing to gather feedback from people within my course and made necessary adjustments to improve the overall performance and user experience.

In the final stage, I created a review for the finished website, highlighting its suitability for the intended audience and original purpose. I explained how the design choices and features incorporated into the website effectively met user requirements and addressed the objectives of promoting mobile phones, accessories, and services. Additionally, I considered constraints such as my beginning knowlage on HTML and ensured that it did not hinder the development process or compromise the quality of the final product. Overall, I was confident that the 'Mobile World Station' website was well-designed and capable of effectively engaging and informing visitors about the offerings/information available."></textarea>
